    "\n",
    "[from perplexity]\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Realistic Representation of Physical Barriers: Reflective conditions can effectively model physical barriers or boundaries in a geographical area, such as coastlines or mountain ranges, where mosquitoes might \"bounce off\" or change direction upon encountering these barriers.\n",
    "* Applicability to Heterogeneous Landscapes: Reflective conditions can better capture the dynamics of mosquito populations in areas with diverse habitats or barriers, as they allow for the simulation of realistic boundary interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Potential for Unrealistic Behavior: If not properly implemented, reflective conditions might lead to unrealistic behavior, such as mosquitoes accumulating at boundaries without dispersing further.\n",
    "* Increased Complexity: Reflective conditions can introduce additional complexity in terms of modeling the interactions between mosquitoes and the environment at these boundaries."
